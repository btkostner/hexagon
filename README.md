# Hexagon

A package server for your organization.

## How to run

This project is still under very active development. You can view a development instance of it running at <https://hexagon.fly.dev>, or simply launch the included `Dockerfile`. You will need a persistent directory to hold your database and store your packages.

## What this is

A simple to get running hex repository designed for a single organization or enterprise.

## What this is not

This _is not_ a SaaS framework or something you would want multiple entities to have access to.
